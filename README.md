How do you feel?

Right after the hackathon I felt stressed and wired. Now that some time has passed I feel proud of what we accomplished, and impressed with how we
accomplished it in such a small amount of time.

What did you think would be easy (but wasn't)?

Git was definitely more difficult than we anticipated. We thought pulling
would be easy, but we ended up taking a lot of time to get synched up and we definitely ended up deleting and re-pulling the repo a few times.

What did you think would be hard (but was easy)?
Once I got through a few poor attempts at using other API's for speech including API.ai, Watson, Google Voice. I finally got to Google Speech which worked pretty easily once I had the source code.

What techniques did you successfully utilize to work in a team?

We met as a team a lot, and were constantly communicating with eachother while we were working. It really helped keep us all on the same page working separately on separate tasks when we could, and pair programming on the same tasks when we could.

  What wasn't useful to work in a team?

  In a longer term project I think wireframes are very important. In our timecrunch hackathon mad dash, we ended up writing wireframes and completely ignoring them.

  What would you change to work in a team?

  I wouldn't change much. I think we were very successful in taking on a task and accomplishing it.

  What were the road blocks to working successfully in a team?

  We had to really talk through issues and make sure tasks were delegated. There were some bottlenecks where people couldn't work until someone else was done. In those instances we would pair program to help with issues, or we would leave them alone to work until their task was completed.

What did you learn?

I learned the google speech api has the word Quesarito. Also we learned that we can accomplish a lot in a small amount of time as long as we don't care what the code looks like.

What did YOU kick ass at?
Cooper - Google speech API
Brad - Project management and leadership
Courtney -
Nate -

What is "going into your learning queue"?
I'm still wrapping my head around express and how routes are organized.


How did you project scope change?
There were some scary times when the voice API wasn't working, and we almost reduced the scope of our project. In the end we managed to accomplish what we originally planned, so it didn't change much.
